# Neural-network-for-Image-Classification-with-Tensorflow
In this project we load the fashion mnist dataset from **keras.datasets**  train it and evaluate its performance with some test samples.

The **Key Steps** are:

**1.** Importing the Module

**2.** Loading the Dataset

**2.** Splitting the Dataset

**4.** Visualize the data

**5.** Build the Model

**6.** Fit the Model

**7.** Evaluate the Model Performance
